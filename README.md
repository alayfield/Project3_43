# Ranked Records

## Overview
Welcome to Ranked Records! The main purpose of this project is to find you a new record to listen to <br>
based on what you already love. Answer a quick survey on your favorite decade of music and favorite <br>
albums and we will find for you something similar based on quantifiable album features. We use both <br>
Euclidean distance and Mahalanobis distance to compare your taste with our catalog.
